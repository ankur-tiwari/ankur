# Hello, I'm Ankur Tiwari

Full-Stack | Web | Mobile (Laravel, Mean & React)


## About Me

I'm Technology Head at Gyrix, your software development partner. I've been working with many startups and established companies throughout my years in the IT. I've learned to outline and fulfill their needs and demands. Since then it has been my personal focus: how to select professionals, assemble and manage remote teams, build project-oriented work processes and adjust them to the businesses of the clients I worked with, and make regular timely deliveries.

I believe that ideas and passion mean as much. The people I work with have plenty of great ideas that we make tangible. These people stir up real mini-revolutions in their industries – and I believe in them. Their products make the life of end users easier and better – and it inspires me. I am fully dedicated to mutual trust and success, teamwork, long-term collaboration, and the importance of what we do together.
